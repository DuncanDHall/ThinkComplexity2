Cheney, et alia, have succeeded in simulating join evolution in body and nervous system with promising results. The vast majority of applications of evolution in programming utilize it only for development and optimization of control systems, but in physiological evolution both body and nervous systems change together over time. Their success has come from implementing what they call "Morphological Innovation Protection" which allows the control systems in individuals with varied morphology a chance to adapt to that new morphology before being selected against. The agents simulated are constructed of voxels with their primary goal being that of locomotion as measured by voxel widths with consistent ability for actuation.
